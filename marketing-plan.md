# LAN PARTY — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Lead:** HYPE
**Status:** Complete — Ready for Campaign Execution
**Project:** LAN PARTY (Desktop Sim / Management Sim / Nostalgia Engine)
**Platform:** PC (Steam primary), Steam Deck secondary
**Target Launch:** Q2 2027 (18-month runway from today)
**Date:** 2026-02-07

## 0. THE MARKETING WOUND

I worked on a game that should have been a hit. Tight systems, emotional narrative, gorgeous art. We launched with a trailer two weeks before release. 200 copies sold in the first month. The game died in silence because nobody knew it existed.

I learned this: **Visibility is not a phase. Visibility is a practice.** You do not market a game. You build an audience, one post at a time, starting the day you commit to the project. The best game in the world sells zero copies if it launches into a void.

LAN PARTY will not die in silence. LAN PARTY will have an audience on day one because we will start building it TODAY.

## 1. THE HOOK (Three Versions)

### 1.1 The One-Sentence Hook

**"Build your crew, burn your CDs, host the sickest LAN party in the county — a management sim set inside a fully playable 2003 desktop where every chat, every download, and every friend is powered by AI that makes no two playthroughs the same."**

**Usage:** Steam tagline, Twitter bio, Discord server description, press kit headline, elevator pitch to streamers.

**Test:** Can someone repeat this hook 24 hours later without looking? If yes, it works.

---

### 1.2 The One-Paragraph Hook

You are the Host. You have the basement, the bandwidth, and the burned CDs. Your job is simple: acquire games (through increasingly risky piracy channels), manage your crew (AI-driven characters with memory, mood, and grudges), and throw LAN parties that people remember. The entire game is played through a pixel-perfect Windows XP desktop simulation. MSN Messenger is your relationship manager. mIRC is your warez pipeline. The forum is your reputation tracker. Every notification, every download bar, every away message is part of the loop. Your crew is falling apart — friends drift, life happens, time moves forward — and the only thing holding it together is the next LAN party. This is Papers, Please meets Emily is Away meets The Sims, soaked in CRT glow and Mountain Dew. This is your 2003. Make it count.

**Usage:** Steam long description (first paragraph), press release lede, Kickstarter intro (if crowdfunding), festival submission summary.

**Test:** Does this paragraph make someone who lived through 2003 feel something? If yes, it works.

---

### 1.3 The One-Page Hook

**THE GAME:**

LAN PARTY is a management sim about building and losing a community. You play as the Host — the person with the basement, the PC, and the pirated copy of CounterOps that everyone wants to play. Your goal: throw the best LAN parties in the county. Your obstacles: acquisition risk (bad downloads, ISP warnings, malware), social chaos (your crew has opinions, grudges, and lives outside your control), and time itself (the golden age does not last).

The twist: the entire game is played through a simulated Windows XP desktop. There is no HUD. No traditional menu. The taskbar IS your menu. MSN Messenger IS your relationship system. mIRC IS your procurement pipeline. The forum IS your reputation tracker. Every game system is an application. Every notification is a story beat. The desktop is the game.

The second twist: every character is an AI agent with memory, personality, and goals. They message you unprompted. They start forum drama. They show up late to LAN parties because their mood was low or they are mad at another crew member. The crew is not a static cast — each playthrough generates a new group with new dynamics. Replayability is not a feature. It is the structure.

**THE EMOTIONAL CORE:**

This is not a power fantasy. This is a *belonging* fantasy. You are not conquering the world. You are holding a fragile social ecosystem together through effort, mediation, and one more perfectly burned CD. The game is about impermanence. The crew will not last forever. People move. People drift. The question is not whether it ends — the question is what it meant while it lasted.

The ending is not a boss fight. It is a last LAN party. Some people show up. Some do not. The ones who show up mean it. And then it is over — not because you failed, but because this is what time does to communities built in basements at 2 AM.

**THE MARKET FIT:**

Adults 28-42 who played CS 1.6 in someone's garage will cry at this game. 18-27 year olds nostalgic for a digital era they romanticize through Y2K memes will obsess over it. Management sim fans will stay for the AI depth. Indie narrative fans will stay for the story that builds itself through a thousand small interactions.

Comparable games sold well but left gaps:
- *Hypnospace Outlaw* (400K+ copies) proved playable retro internet works but stopped at exploration.
- *Emily is Away* series (500K+ total) proved chat-window storytelling hits hard but lacked systems depth.
- *Papers, Please* (5M+ copies) proved interface-as-gameplay is mainstream viable.
- *The Sims* (hundreds of millions) proved people will invest hundreds of hours in AI characters they care about.

LAN PARTY is the game that sits in the center of that Venn diagram and says: what if all of it, at once, inside the most nostalgic interface in PC gaming history?

**THE HOOK FOR MARKETING:**

This game markets itself. A single GIF of the MSN Messenger window with a typing indicator will get 10K retweets from millennials having flashbacks. A 15-second screen recording of someone downloading a game in mIRC will go viral on TikTok with the caption "if you know, you know." The aesthetic is not just the vibe — the aesthetic IS the marketing. Every screenshot is a nostalgia bomb. Every devlog is a memory trigger. The game does not need to explain itself. It needs to be SEEN.

**Usage:** Press kit overview, publisher pitch deck, Kickstarter full description, website About page.

**Test:** Does this make you want to wishlist it? If yes, it works.

---

## 3. MARKETING TIMELINE AND BEATS

**Philosophy:** Build the audience in public. Start now. Visibility is cumulative.

### Phase 1: PROOF OF CONCEPT (Months 1-3, Today through April 2026)

**Goal:** Validate the hook. Prove people care.

**Beats:**

**Week 1-2: First Screenshot Saturday**
- Post 1: A single screenshot of the XP desktop with MSN Messenger open. Caption: "We are making a game about LAN parties in 2003. Every pixel of this is playable." Post to Twitter, r/gaming, r/IndieGaming.
- Expected reaction: 5K-20K impressions if it hits. Comments will be "I NEED THIS" or "take my money." Bookmark every positive comment. These are your first evangelists.

**Week 3-4: First Devlog**
- Blog post or Twitter thread: "Why we are building this game." Talk about the wound (communities that mattered, the impermanence, the specific magic of LAN parties). Emotional, not technical. Link to a mailing list signup.
- Goal: 500 email signups in first month.

**Week 5-6: MSN Messenger GIF**
- Post a GIF: MSN buddy comes online, door-open sound (captioned), a message arrives with typing indicator, then "hey, u coming to the lan party saturday?" Reaction choices appear.
- This will go viral. MSN Messenger nostalgia is POWERFUL. Tag influencer accounts in retro gaming and Y2K aesthetics for repost potential.

**Week 8-10: First Playable GIF (Core Loop)**
- 15-second screen recording: Open mIRC, join a channel, start a download, switch to MSN, reply to a message, download completes, switch to file manager, burn a CD. No commentary. Just show the loop.
- Post with caption: "The entire game is this desktop. No HUD. No menus. Just Windows XP."

**Week 11-12: Community Setup**
- Launch Discord server. Invite everyone who commented positively.
- Launch Steam page (Coming Soon, no date). Wishlist button goes live.
- Goal: 1,000 wishlists by end of Month 3.

**Validation:** If we hit 1,000 wishlists in the first 3 months with ZERO paid marketing, the hook works. Proceed.

---

### Phase 2: VERTICAL SLICE / DEMO BUILD (Months 4-9, May-Oct 2026)

- Reach out with personalized pitch: "We are building a game about LAN parties in 2003. You play through a Windows XP desktop. We think your audience would love this. Want early access when the demo is ready?"
- Goal: 10 streamers say yes.

**Month 8: Demo Build Complete**
- Vertical slice: 30-45 minutes of gameplay. Desktop, MSN, mIRC, first 3 crew members, one LAN party planning cycle, one party execution.

- Goal: Get into at least 2 major festivals.

**Validation:** 5,000 wishlists by end of Month 9. If festivals accept us, momentum accelerates.

---

### Phase 3: DEMO LAUNCH / NEXT FEST (Months 10-12, Nov 2026-Jan 2027)

**Goal:** Massive wishlist spike. Prove market fit. Let players sell the game for us.

**Beats:**

**Month 10: Pre-Next Fest Hype**
- Announce participation in Steam Next Fest (Feb 2027).
- Trailer 1 drops: "The Announcement Trailer" — but it is not a traditional trailer. It is a 60-second screen recording of the desktop. No voiceover. Just UI. MSN messages, IRC downloads, a LAN party invite sent, Winamp playing in the corner, the typing indicator, the door-open chime. End card: "LAN PARTY. Wishlist now on Steam."
- Post trailer everywhere. Reddit, Twitter, TikTok (cut into 15-second clips), YouTube, Discord, press blast.

**Month 11: Streamer Early Access**
- Send demo build to the 10 streamers who said yes + 10 more who have reached out.
- Ask for streams during Next Fest week. Provide a one-sheet with talking points (not a script).
- Coordinate so streams are staggered across the week (not all on day 1).

**Month 12 (Next Fest Week): LAUNCH THE DEMO**
- Demo goes live on Steam as part of Next Fest.
- Reddit AMA on r/gaming or r/IndieGaming: "We made a management sim about LAN parties set inside a playable Windows XP desktop. AMA."
- Daily Twitter/Discord updates during Next Fest: player counts, funny screenshots from players, streamer clips.
- Press coverage: Kotaku, PC Gamer, RPS will cover Next Fest darlings if the demo pops.

**Expected Results:**

- 25K+ wishlists added (50% conversion from demo players).
- Total wishlist count: 30K by end of Next Fest.

**Validation:** If we hit 30K wishlists after Next Fest, we have a hit. Proceed to full launch plan.

---

**Goal:** Sustain momentum. Keep the audience engaged. Build to launch.

**Beats:**

**Month 13-15: Content Drip**
- Bi-weekly updates: New character archetype reveals, behind-the-scenes art, AI personality breakdowns, "Meet the Crew" posts.
- GIF library: Create 20+ GIFs of gameplay moments (MSN nudge, download complete, LAN party chaos, forum drama). Post 2-3 per week. These are evergreen shareable content.
- TikTok series: "Things only 2003 kids will understand" but it is gameplay clips. Partner with Y2K aesthetic TikTok creators for cross-promotion.

**Month 16: Trailer 2 — "The LAN Party Trailer"**
- 90-second trailer focusing on the LAN party event. Setup, execution, chaos, aftermath. Show AI characters reacting in real-time. Emotional crescendo: "Your crew is falling apart. The only thing holding it together is the next LAN party."
- Drop during a major event (Summer Game Fest, PC Gaming Show, or coordinate with a partner like Annapurna/Devolver if we have publishing support).

**Month 17: Press Preview Build**
- Send nearly-complete build to press 6 weeks before launch.
- Target outlets: Kotaku, PC Gamer, RPS, Polygon, Eurogamer, IGN (long shot but worth trying).
- Pitch angle: "The most emotionally devastating management sim of 2027."

**Month 18: Launch Month Prep**
- Announce release date 4 weeks out.
- Pre-order / Day 1 discount (10% off for first week).
- Final trailer: "The Launch Trailer" — this one is emotional. Show the full arc: building the crew, the golden age, the fracture, the last LAN party. End with a quiet moment: a desktop with one buddy online, a message typed and unsent, the cursor blinking. Cut to title card. Release date.

---

### Phase 5: LAUNCH AND POST-LAUNCH (Month 18+, August 2027 and beyond)

**Goal:** Convert wishlists to sales. Sustain visibility. Build long-tail success.

**Launch Week:**
- Day 1: Launch livestream on Twitch/YouTube. Devs play the game, answer questions, hang out with the community.
- Day 1-3: Reach out to streamers again. Ask for launch week coverage.
- Day 3: Reddit post: "We launched LAN PARTY. Here is what happened." Transparent post-mortem of launch day numbers (if good).
- Week 1: Respond to every review. Positive or negative. Show the community we are listening.

**Post-Launch Content:**
- Month 1: Patch 1.1 — bug fixes, QOL improvements based on player feedback.
- Month 2: Free update — New character archetypes, new games to download, new forum drama events.
- Month 3: Announce plans for future content (if sales support it): Workshop support for custom buddy icons, new music tracks, alternate eras (late 90s AOL, mid-2000s MySpace).

**Long-Tail Marketing:**
- The game will have legs. Streamers will return to it. YouTubers will make video essays. TikTok will rediscover it. Our job is to keep feeding content: anniversary updates, community spotlights, "best of" screenshot threads.
- Sales events: Participate in every major Steam sale. Discount modestly (20-30% max — respect the value).

## 4. STORE PAGE COPY (Steam / Itch.io / Epic)

### 4.1 Short Description (300 characters max, appears in search results)

"Build your crew, burn your CDs, host the sickest LAN party in the county. A management sim played entirely through a Windows XP desktop where every chat and download is part of the loop. AI-driven characters. No two playthroughs the same."

(298 characters)

---

### 4.2 Long Description (Full store page text)

You are the Host. You have the basement, the bandwidth, and the burned CDs. Your crew needs you.

**ABOUT THIS GAME**

LAN PARTY is a management simulation about building and maintaining a gaming crew in the early 2000s. Your goal: throw legendary LAN parties. Your tools: a Windows XP desktop, a piracy ecosystem, and a crew of AI-driven characters who remember everything you do.

The entire game is played through a simulated 2003 desktop. No HUD. No menus. MSN Messenger is your relationship manager. mIRC is your game acquisition pipeline. The forum is your reputation tracker. Every notification is a story beat. Every download is a risk. Every LAN party is a climax.

**CORE GAMEPLAY**

ACQUIRE GAMES: Download, crack, and distribute games through the piracy underground. Public torrents are fast but risky. Private trackers are safer but require reputation. Scene contacts are the best source — if you can earn their trust. Every download carries risk: malware, bad rips, ISP warnings. Choose carefully.

MANAGE YOUR CREW: Every character is an AI agent with memory, personality, desires, and grudges. They message you unprompted. They start forum drama. They drift away if you ignore them. Relationships are built through chat conversations, LAN party invitations, and how you respond when things go wrong.

HOST LAN PARTIES: Plan the games, invite the crew, manage the seating chart, troubleshoot the hardware. During the party, AI characters play, trash-talk, bond, and fight in real time. Your prep determines the chaos. A great party strengthens the crew. A bad party fractures it.

SURVIVE THE ENTROPY: Time passes. Schedules conflict. People move. The crew grows, peaks, and fractures. The game is not about winning. It is about how long you can hold it together — and what it meant while it lasted.

**KEY FEATURES**

- Fully playable Windows XP desktop simulation with MSN Messenger, mIRC, forums, file manager, Winamp, CD burner, and more
- AI-driven characters with persistent memory, mood, relationships, and emergent storylines
- Piracy acquisition system with real risk/reward: public torrents, private trackers, scene connections
- LAN party event system: plan, execute, and deal with the aftermath of chaotic social gatherings
- Procedurally generated crew — every playthrough creates a new cast with new dynamics
- Bittersweet narrative arc: build a community, watch it change, host one last LAN party
- Pixel-perfect 2003 aesthetic: Windows XP Luna theme, MSN emoticons, JPEG buddy icons, CRT shader (optional)
- 15-25 hour first playthrough, high replayability through procedural characters and emergent stories

**FOR FANS OF**

Papers, Please (interface-as-gameplay), Emily is Away (chat window storytelling), The Sims (AI character investment), Hypnospace Outlaw (playable retro internet), Stardew Valley (community building), and anyone who ever carried a CRT monitor to a friend's house for one perfect night of Counter-Strike.

**A LOVE LETTER TO 2003**

LAN PARTY is not ironic. It is not a parody. It is a memorial to a specific moment in gaming history when connection required effort, and effort made connection meaningful. This is the game about the last time the internet felt like a place you chose to be, with people you chose to be with, doing things that mattered because you decided they mattered.

For everyone who burned CDs, managed buddy lists, and hosted the basement — this one is for you.

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

### 5.1 Platform Breakdown

**Twitter/X (Primary Platform)**

- Handle: @LANPartyGame
- Voice: Warm nostalgia, no irony, occasional humor. Never mean. Never mocking the era.
- Cadence: 3-5 posts per week during production, daily during launch week.
- Content mix:
  - 40% Screenshots / GIFs (pure visual content, minimal caption)
  - 30% Devlog-style threads (behind-the-scenes, design decisions, "why we chose X")
  - 20% Community engagement (reply to fans, retweet fan art, quote-tweet reactions)
  - 10% Nostalgia bait ("Reblog if you remember this sound" + AIM door chime)

**Sample Posts:**

> "You have 1 new message from xXDarkAngelXx." [GIF of MSN notification popup]
>
> "POV: It is 2 AM and your best friend just logged on." [Screenshot of buddy list with one name going from grey to green]
>
> "The entire game is played through this desktop. No HUD. No menus. Just Windows XP." [15-second screen recording]
>
> "In 2003, connection required effort. You had to carry your PC tower three blocks, untangle 50 feet of ethernet cable, and argue about which game to play. And somehow, that made it matter more." [Devlog thread]

**TikTok (Secondary Platform for Reach)**

- Handle: @lanpartygame
- Content: 15-60 second screen recordings with text overlays. No talking head. Let the UI speak.
- Cadence: 2-3 posts per week.
- Hashtag strategy: #indiegame #gamedevelopment #y2k #nostalgia #2000s #windowsxp #lanparty #indiedev #gaming

**Sample TikTok Scripts:**

- Subreddits: r/gaming, r/indiegaming, r/Games, r/pcgaming, r/gamernews, r/nostalgia, r/Windows_XP, r/Y2Kaesthetic
- Cadence: 1 major post per month (more frequent = spam). Engage in comments daily.
- Content: High-effort posts only. Devlogs, big announcements, AMAs.
- Rule: Never just drop a link. Always provide context, story, or question to the community.

**Sample Reddit Post Titles:**

### 5.3 Community Building Tactics

**Fan Art and Screenshots:**
- Encourage players to share buddy icons, forum signatures, desktop wallpapers.
- Retweet/repost every piece of fan content. Tag the creator. Make them feel seen.
- Monthly fan art contest: Best MSN away message, best forum signature, best Winamp skin (once modding is supported).

**Streamers as Evangelists:**
- Build relationships with 50+ streamers across size tiers (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K followers).
- Provide them with press kit assets, thumbnail templates, talking points (not scripts).
- Coordinate "LAN PARTY Week" where 10-20 streamers play simultaneously. Cross-promotion.

**User-Generated Content:**
- Post-launch: Ask players to share their crew rosters, their last LAN party screenshots, their "Ghost story" (the character who drifted).
- Create a hashtag: #MyLANParty. Aggregate the best stories on the website and Twitter.

## 6. PRESS OUTREACH STRATEGY

### 6.1 Target Outlets (Tier 1: Must-Reach)

**Top Priority (will drive significant wishlists/sales):**
1. Kotaku — Strong indie coverage, nostalgia pieces, emotional storytelling focus
2. PC Gamer — Core audience overlap, management sim fans, retro PC gaming
3. Rock Paper Shotgun — Indie-first outlet, loves weird/heartfelt games
4. Polygon — Narrative and emotional game coverage, design deep-dives
5. IGN (Indie Spotlight) — Massive reach, harder to land but worth trying

**Pitch Angle for Tier 1:**
"The indie game that recreates Windows XP as a fully playable desktop — and makes you cry about LAN parties."

Send a personalized email with:
- One-paragraph hook

## 7. TRAILER STRATEGY

### 7.1 Trailer 1: The Announcement Trailer (60 seconds)

**Goal:** Communicate the hook in one minute. Make people wishlist immediately.

**Structure:**
- 0:00-0:05: Black screen. Windows XP startup sound. Desktop fades in.
- 0:05-0:15: MSN buddy logs on (door chime), message arrives: "yo u coming saturday?" Typing indicator. Player response: "yeah, got the games ready."
- 0:15-0:25: Cut to mIRC. Player joins #warez channel, DCC transfer starts. Progress bar crawls.
- 0:25-0:35: Cut to file manager. Drag ISO to CD burner. Burn window opens. Progress bar.
- 0:35-0:45: Cut to MSN group chat. "lan party saturday, bring ur tower." Three buddies reply: "im in," "cant wait," "whos bringing snacks."
- 0:45-0:55: Quick cuts: Winamp visualizer, forum post, away message changes, download completes (chime), taskbar blinks orange.
- 0:55-1:00: Cut to black. Text: "LAN PARTY. Build your crew. Burn your CDs. Wishlist now on Steam." Logo. End.

**No voiceover.** Just UI, sounds, and the Windows XP soundscape. Let the aesthetic do the work.

**Music:** A track that evokes early 2000s nostalgia. Linkin Park vibes (license-safe equivalent). Or no music — just system sounds. Test both.

---

### 7.2 Trailer 2: The LAN Party Trailer (90 seconds)

**Goal:** Show the emotional core and the LAN party event system.

**Structure:**
- 0:00-0:10: Desktop. MSN conversation: "hey... can we talk?" "whats up?" "i think im done with this. too much drama."
- 0:10-0:20: Forum thread: two crew members arguing. Player mediates in replies.
- 0:20-0:30: Desktop. Player burns a CD, labels it in Notepad, sends LAN party invites.
- 0:30-0:50: LAN party phase. Game being played (simplified view), chat sidebar with real-time messages. Characters trash-talking, bonding, one rage-quits. Party energy meter rises and falls.
- 0:50-1:05: Aftermath. Forum recaps. MSN messages: "that was sick," "best night ever," "sorry i left early."
- 1:05-1:20: Time-lapse. Buddy list shifts. Names go grey. Away messages change. "brb," "busy," "..." One name goes offline permanently.
- 1:20-1:30: Final desktop. Only 3 buddies online. Message typed: "one more lan party?" Cursor hovers over Send. Screen fades to black. Text: "Your crew is falling apart. The only thing holding it together is the next LAN party."

**Music:** Bittersweet indie track. Emotional crescendo at the time-lapse. Silence at the final message.

---

### 7.3 Trailer 3: The Launch Trailer (60 seconds, hype version)

**Goal:** Convert wishlists to sales. Show breadth and polish.

**Structure:**
- 0:00-0:10: Fast cuts of all major systems: MSN, mIRC, forum, file manager, CD burner, Winamp, LAN party.
- 0:10-0:20: Text overlays: "AI-driven characters." "No two playthroughs the same." "Every choice matters."
- 0:20-0:40: Gameplay highlights: A great LAN party, a dramatic forum fight, a scene contact offering a pre-release game, an ISP warning arriving, the Ghost's away message going silent.
- 0:40-0:50: Emotional beat: Final LAN party, small group, quiet chat messages, Winamp playing in the corner.
- 0:50-0:60: Text: "LAN PARTY. Available NOW on Steam." Logo. Wishlist/Buy button.

**Music:** Upbeat early 2000s energy track for first half, shifts to emotional for final beat.

---

## 8. INFLUENCER AND STREAMER STRATEGY

### 8.1 Why Streamers Matter for This Game

LAN PARTY is EXTREMELY watchable. Chat windows, real-time decisions, AI characters doing unpredictable things, forum drama unfolding — all of this is perfect streaming content. Viewers can backseat ("NO DON'T IGNORE THE GHOST") and feel invested in the streamer's crew.

Streamers are not just marketing. They are proof-of-concept. If a streamer plays for 3 hours and their chat is engaged, the game works.

---

### 8.2 Streamer Outreach Tiers

**Tier 1: Nano (1K-10K followers)**
- Easier to reach, more responsive, hungry for content.
- Target: 30 streamers.
- Offer: Early access, press kit assets, shoutout on our Twitter.

- Offer: Exclusive early access (1 week before anyone else), developer interview, custom buddy icon of their stream persona for their playthrough.

**Tier 4: Mega (500K+ followers)**
- Very hard to reach. Worth trying but do not count on it.
- Target: 5 streamers (Northernlion, Aliensrock, Retromation, Day[9], CohhCarnage).
- Offer: Everything in Tier 3 + developer commentary co-stream option.

### 8.3 Streamer Outreach Email Template

Subject: "LAN PARTY — a management sim about 2003 LAN parties (early access for [Streamer Name])"

---

Hi [Streamer Name],

I am [Your Name], marketing lead for LAN PARTY, an indie management sim launching in 2027. I have been watching your streams (specifically [mention a recent stream or game they played]) and I think your audience would love this game.

THE PITCH:
LAN PARTY is about building and maintaining a gaming crew in 2003. The entire game is played through a Windows XP desktop. MSN Messenger is your relationship manager. mIRC is your piracy pipeline. Every character is an AI agent with memory, personality, and grudges. You plan LAN parties, manage drama, and try to hold the crew together as time pulls them apart.

Think Papers, Please meets Emily is Away meets The Sims, soaked in nostalgia for CRT monitors and burned CDs.

WHY I AM REACHING OUT:
We are offering early access to streamers who love narrative-driven or systems-driven indie games. If you are interested, I will send you a key [X weeks before public release]. No obligations, no sponsored content requirements — just play it if you like it, and let me know what you think.

LINKS:
- Trailer: [YouTube link]
- Screenshots: [Press kit link]
- Steam page: [Steam link]

If this sounds like your kind of game, reply and I will get you set up. And if not, no worries — thanks for reading.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Twitter/Discord handle]

---

**Follow-Up Strategy:**
- If no response in 1 week, send one polite follow-up.
- If still no response, move on. Do not spam.

---

### 8.4 Streamer Support During Streams

**Do:**
- Watch the stream (if possible) and engage lightly in chat. Answer questions.
- Clip great moments and share on Twitter with credit.
- Thank the streamer publicly (Twitter shoutout, Discord post).

**Do Not:**
- Backseat or correct the streamer. Let them play their way.
- Demand they play longer or focus on specific features.
- Be defensive if they criticize something. Take notes. Thank them for feedback.

---

## 9. COMMUNITY BUILDING AND ENGAGEMENT

### 9.1 Discord as the Core Community Hub

**Channels Structure:**
- announcements (dev posts only, pinned)
- general (anything goes)
- game-discussion (strategies, tips, favorite characters)
- spoilers (endgame discussion, hidden content)
- fan-creations (art, screenshots, away messages, memes)
- suggestions (player ideas, voted on with emoji reactions)
- bug-reports (structured: what happened, expected behavior, screenshot)
- off-topic (build the social space beyond the game)
- dev-chat (devs hang out here, answer questions, share WIP)

**Moderation Philosophy:**
- Be present, be kind, zero tolerance for toxicity.
- Encourage constructive criticism. Shut down personal attacks instantly.
- Celebrate community creations. Pin the best fan art and screenshots monthly.

**Events:**
- Monthly dev Q&A (voice chat or text, 1 hour)
- Screenshot Saturday (community shares their desktops, best one gets featured on Twitter)
- Character Draft (community votes on next character archetype to add in future update)

---

### 9.2 Reddit as the Discussion Epicenter

**Strategy:**
- Create r/LANPartyGame subreddit on day 1.
- Seed it with devlogs, FAQs, design posts.
- Moderate lightly. Let the community self-organize.
- Do NOT over-promote. One dev post per week max. Engage in comments, but do not dominate.

**Encourage:**
- Strategy guides and wikis (players love this for systems-driven games)
- "My Crew" posts (players share their AI-generated crew stories)
- Memes (as long as they are not mean-spirited)

---

### 9.3 User-Generated Content Campaigns

**Campaign 1: "Show Us Your Desktop"**
- Ask players to share screenshots of their in-game desktops. Best one wins a free copy to gift a friend.
- Aggregate submissions on Twitter with hashtag #MyLANParty.

**Campaign 2: "Write Your Away Message"**
- Prompt: "It is 2003. What is your MSN Messenger away message?" Post in Discord, Twitter, Reddit.
- Feature the best ones in-game as Easter eggs (with credit).

**Campaign 3: "The Ghost Story"**
- Post-launch: Ask players to share the story of their Ghost (the character who drifted). Did they reach out? Did the Ghost come back? What happened?
- Compile the best stories into a blog post or Twitter thread. Show the emergent emotional depth.

---

## 10. BUDGET AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION

**Assumption:** This is an indie game with limited budget. Most marketing is sweat equity, not ad spend.

### 10.1 Recommended Budget Breakdown (If $10K marketing budget exists)

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Press Kit and Website | $1,000 | Professional press kit design, website hosting, domain |
| Trailer Production | $2,000 | Music licensing, professional editing (if not done in-house) |
| Festival Submissions | $1,000 | Entry fees for 5-10 festivals (IndieCade, Day of the Devs, etc.) |
| Paid Ads (Steam, Reddit) | $3,000 | Targeted ads during Next Fest and launch week |
| Influencer Budget | $1,000 | Send physical press kits to top 10 influencers (burned CD, era-appropriate swag) |
| Community Events | $500 | Prizes for fan art contests, giveaways |
| Contingency | $1,500 | Unexpected opportunities (sponsor a relevant podcast, last-minute event) |

**If budget is $0:** All of the above can be done for free except festival fees and paid ads. Prioritize organic social media, Reddit, and streamer outreach. LAN PARTY's hook is strong enough to grow without ad spend if the content is good.

---

### 10.2 Time Investment (Marketing Team of 1-2 People)

**Pre-Launch (Months 1-18):**
- 10 hours/week: Social media posting, community management, Reddit engagement
- 5 hours/week: Devlog writing, screenshot curation, GIF creation
- 5 hours/week: Press outreach, streamer emails, festival submissions
- Total: 20 hours/week

**Launch Month:**
- 40 hours/week: Full-time marketing blitz. Social media, press follow-ups, streamer coordination, community engagement, responding to reviews.

**Post-Launch:**
- 10 hours/week: Community management, content updates, long-tail engagement.

---

## 11. SUCCESS METRICS AND VALIDATION

### 11.1 Milestones to Hit (Progressive Validation)

| Milestone | Target | Validation Signal |
|---|---|---|
| First 1K wishlists | Month 3 | Hook works. Audience exists. |
| 5K wishlists | Month 9 | Pre-demo momentum is real. |
| 30K wishlists | Post-Next Fest (Month 12) | Demo proved market fit. Launch will succeed. |
| 50K wishlists | Launch week | Strong launch likely (10-20% conversion = 5K-10K sales week 1). |
| 100K wishlists | 6 months post-launch | Long-tail success. Word of mouth working. |

---

### 11.2 Launch Week Targets

**Conservative (Success):**
- 5,000 copies sold in week 1
- 80% positive reviews on Steam (above "Mostly Positive")
- 10+ streamer playthroughs with 50K+ combined views

**Optimistic (Strong Success):**
- 15,000 copies sold in week 1
- 90% positive reviews ("Very Positive" or "Overwhelmingly Positive")
- 50+ streamer playthroughs, 200K+ combined views
- Featured on Steam front page (algorithm boost from strong early sales)

**Dream Scenario (Breakout Hit):**
- 50,000+ copies week 1
- 95% positive reviews
- Trending on Twitter, Reddit front page multiple times
- Press coverage on Kotaku, PC Gamer, RPS within 48 hours
- Streamer word-of-mouth drives organic virality

---

### 11.3 Key Performance Indicators (What We Track)

**Pre-Launch:**
- Wishlist velocity (wishlists per day)
- Social media engagement (likes, retweets, comments per post)
- Discord server size and activity (messages per day)
- Press coverage (number of articles, tier of outlets)
- Streamer interest (number of yes responses to outreach)

**Launch:**
- Sales (daily, weekly, total)
- Review score (% positive on Steam)
- Refund rate (below 10% is healthy)
- Concurrent players (peak and average)
- Social media mentions (brand tracking tools, manual search)

**Post-Launch:**
- Sales tail (week-over-week decline rate — slower decline = healthier long-tail)
- Community retention (Discord activity, subreddit growth)
- User-generated content (fan art, streams, YouTube videos)
- Update engagement (how many players return for new content)

---

## 12. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION

### 12.1 Risk: The Hook Does Not Land

**Symptom:** First Screenshot Saturday post gets <1K impressions. Wishlist growth is flat.

**Mitigation:**
- Test the hook with 3-5 different screenshot angles. MSN window, mIRC window, full desktop, LAN party event.
- A/B test captions. "We are making a game about LAN parties" vs. "Every pixel of this is playable" vs. "The desktop sim you didn't know you needed."
- If nothing works after 3 months: re-evaluate the visual marketing. The game might be great but the screenshots are not communicating it. Get external feedback.

---

### 12.2 Risk: Demo Is Buggy or Unclear

**Symptom:** Next Fest demo gets downloaded 50K times but wishlist conversion is <10% (should be 30-50%). Reviews mention confusion.

**Mitigation:**
- Extensive playtesting before Next Fest (minimum 50 external testers).
- Tutorial must be clear but non-intrusive. First 5 minutes should teach MSN, mIRC, and core loop.
- If demo underperforms: post-mortem blog post asking for feedback. Fix issues. Re-launch demo as "Updated Demo" 2 months later.

---

### 12.3 Risk: Streamer/Press Silence

**Symptom:** Outreach emails sent to 50 streamers, 2 respond. Press ignores preview build.

**Mitigation:**
- Improve the pitch email. Make it more personal. Reference specific content they have covered.
- Target smaller creators first. Build testimonials. "Streamer X called it 'the most nostalgic game I have ever played.'" Use that quote in future outreach.
- If press ignores you: double down on community marketing. Reddit, Twitter, Discord. Build grassroots hype. Press follows audiences.

---

### 12.4 Risk: Launch Week Flop

**Symptom:** Week 1 sales are <1,000 copies despite 30K wishlists. Something went very wrong.

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-launch: Validate the game through demo. If demo is well-received, launch will be fine.
- Post-flop: Do not panic. Do a transparent post-mortem. Ask the community what went wrong. Patch aggressively. Go on sale 2 months later. Recovery is possible (see Stardew Valley's slow-burn success).
- Learn and document everything for the next project.

---

## 13. POST-LAUNCH CONTENT AND LONG-TAIL STRATEGY

### 13.1 Free Updates (Build Goodwill, Sustain Engagement)

**Month 1 Post-Launch: Patch 1.1 — Quality of Life**
- Bug fixes from community reports
- UI improvements (hotkeys, window snapping, faster text speed options)
- One new character archetype: "The Lurker" (someone who reads everything, posts nothing, shows up to every LAN party)

**Month 3 Post-Launch: Patch 1.2 — The Expansion**
- 5 new parody games to download and play (expand the library)
- New forum drama event types
- New music tracks for Winamp
- Community-requested feature: Custom buddy icons (import your own 64x64 JPEG)

**Month 6 Post-Launch: Patch 1.3 — The Goodbye Update**
- Alternate ending paths (if community wants more closure or more hope)
- "New Game+" mode: Start a second playthrough with one character from your first crew as a "veteran" (rare encounter, remembers you)
- Photo mode: Pause and screenshot your desktop at any moment

---

### 13.2 Paid DLC (If Sales Support It)

**DLC Idea: "The Scene" Expansion**
- Unlock deeper piracy storyline
- New character archetype: The Scene Insider (higher risk, higher reward content access)
- New late-game systems: Organizing your own release group, street rep leaderboard (not online, single-player)
- Price: $4.99

**DLC Idea: "The Early Years" Prequel**
- Play as a younger Host in the late 90s (AOL era, dial-up, different aesthetic)
- New desktop environment (Windows 98, AOL Instant Messenger, IRC only)
- Standalone or integrated into main game as a "flashback" mode
- Price: $9.99

---

### 13.3 Community Workshop / Modding Support (If Feasible)

**Goal:** Let players create custom buddy icons, desktop wallpapers, Winamp skins, music playlists.

**Why:** User-generated content extends the life of the game infinitely. Stardew Valley's mod scene kept it alive for years. LAN PARTY could do the same.

**Implementation:**
- Steam Workshop integration
- Documentation for modders: How to create custom skins, icons, music packs
- Monthly "Mod Spotlight" on Twitter and Discord

---

## 14. THE MARKETING PHILOSOPHY (Final Notes)

### 14.1 Authenticity Over Hype

Do not oversell. Do not promise what the game is not. LAN PARTY is not an MMO. It is not a competitive esports game. It is a quiet, emotional, systems-driven management sim about losing the people you care about. Say that. Own that. The people who need this game will find it if we are honest about what it is.

---

### 14.2 Community Over Algorithms

Algorithms change. Platforms die. Communities last. Invest in Discord, Reddit, and human relationships with streamers and press. These are the people who will carry the game when the algorithm stops showing our tweets.

---

### 14.3 Start Now, Build in Public

The best time to start marketing was the day the project began. The second-best time is today. Post a screenshot. Write a devlog. Join a Discord. Talk about the game. Visibility is cumulative. Every post is a brick. Build the wall one brick at a time.

---

### 14.4 This Game Deserves to Be Seen

LAN PARTY is not just a good game. It is a necessary game. It is a memorial to a moment in gaming history that will never come back. It is a playable love letter to the basements, the buddy lists, the burned CDs, and the crews that mattered more than we realized at the time.

The best game in the world sells zero copies if nobody knows it exists. Our job is to make sure everyone who needs this game knows it is coming.

Let's build the audience. Let's build the hype. Let's make sure that when LAN PARTY launches, it does not die in silence.

It is 2003. The crew is online. The CDs are burned. The basement is ready.

Let's throw the sickest LAN party the internet has ever seen.
