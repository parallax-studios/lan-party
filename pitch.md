## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Build your crew, burn your CDs, host the sickest LAN party in the county — a management sim set inside a fully playable 2000s desktop where every chatroom, every pirated game, and every friend on your buddy list is powered by AI that makes no two playthroughs the same.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "You have 1 new message from xXDarkAngelXx... and it's about to change everything."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

The player browses a pixel-perfect recreation of a 2003 Windows XP desktop. They open mIRC, join a warez channel, get a DCC transfer of a cracked game. They minimize chat. They open MSN Messenger — three friends online, one away with status "brb mom's calling." They drag the .ISO to a virtual CD burner. Cut to: a basement full of CRT monitors, five AI characters trash-talking during the game that just got burned. Winamp plays Linkin Park. Chat messages fly. Someone's ethernet cable gets unplugged. Chaos.

**That's the GIF. That's the game. This is YOUR 2003, alive and breathing.**

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Fantasy

The player wants to feel like the center of a chaotic, loyal, slightly illegal gaming community in the early 2000s. You're the person with the basement, the bandwidth, and the burned CDs.

### Core Loop

**30 seconds:** Read a message, make a choice. Respond to a friend on MSN, browse IRC for warez, download a file, configure your desktop. Every action is a click inside the simulated OS.

**5 minutes:** Manage a LAN party prep cycle. You need: games (acquired legally... or not), hardware (scrounged, borrowed, upgraded), people (invited, convinced, drama-managed), and snacks (the unspoken fourth pillar — a real system).

**30 minutes (session cycle):** Host the LAN party. AI-driven characters show up, play the games you picked, interact based on accumulated relationship states, and generate emergent stories. Someone rage-quits. Two people bond. A friendship forms. A rivalry ignites. Back to desktop for aftermath — MSN conversations, forum posts, IRC gossip.

**Meta loop:** Grow your crew. Gain reputation. Get access to better warez channels. Upgrade your setup. Host bigger events. Navigate the tension between community growth and piracy risks.

### Core Mechanics

1. **Desktop Simulation** — The entire game is played through a simulated 2000s OS. MSN = relationship manager. mIRC = acquisition pipeline. Forums = reputation tracker. Winamp = mood setter. Every app is a game system wearing period-authentic skin.

2. **Community Management** — AI NPCs with persistent personalities, moods, relationships, desires. They message unprompted. They gossip. They fight in your forum. You manage them through chat windows, one awkward conversation at a time.

3. **Acquisition & Risk** — Finding, downloading, cracking, distributing games as a risk/reward loop. Public torrents (high risk), private trackers (medium risk, reputation-gated), scene connections (low risk, hard to access). Bad rips, malware, ISP flags.

4. **LAN Party Hosting** — Planning, setup, execution, aftermath. Hardware logistics. Game selection. Seating arrangements (keep rivals apart). Real-time with AI characters.

5. **Reputation & Progression** — Standing in multiple overlapping communities: friend group, forum, IRC channels, warez scene. Each has its own trust economy. Reputation unlocks access but paints a target.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner hosts a janky party with three people and a crashing game. An expert orchestrates a 12-person tournament with custom brackets, pre-loaded rigs, zero network issues, a curated Winamp playlist, and a community so loyal they show up in the rain carrying their towers.

### Unique Mechanic: The Living Desktop

The ENTIRE interface is the game. No "game UI" — just Windows XP. Every application is a game system. Opening MSN opens your relationship tool. Opening mIRC opens procurement. **The nostalgia IS the mechanic.** The AI lives behind the curtain — players see buddy lists, download managers, forum threads. Every word of dialogue, every post, every away message is generated by agents with memory, personality, and agenda.

### Depth Stress-Test

- **Hour 1:** Setting up desktop, meeting contacts, downloading first game. Pure nostalgia vibes.
- **Hour 20:** Managing 15+ crew, navigating a factional split, hosting a tournament while your best friend and scene contact are in cold war. ISP warning letter. Hard drive almost full.
- **Hour 100:** You're a legend. Or burned out. Procedural narrative has taken you through friendships that felt real, betrayals that stung, and magical LAN parties. New save = new cast = new era = new story.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**LAN PARTY is about the impermanence of community** — how the most intense social bonds can form in someone's basement over a weekend, and how time inevitably pulls them apart.

It's about the specific ache of a friend group that existed in a particular technological moment — when the internet was small enough to feel personal but big enough to feel infinite. When you had to physically carry your computer to someone's house to play together. When effort was the price of connection.

Every mechanic tells this story. The cluttered desktop tells the story of a life filling up. MSN statuses shifting from "ONLINE" to "Away" to "Appear Offline" tell the story of people drifting. LAN parties getting harder to schedule tell the story of growing up.

### The World

A suburban town in the early 2000s, but you never see it directly. You see it through chat windows, forum posts, blurry webcam shots, and desktop wallpapers. The world is MEDIATED — experienced through screens within a screen. A town of 50,000, but your universe is 20 screen names and a handful of IRC channels.

The wound: **it doesn't know it's ending.** Broadband is about to kill the LAN party. Steam is about to kill the burned CD. Facebook is about to kill the forum. The characters live in a golden age and don't know it.

### The Player's Emotional Arc

**Beginning:** Excitement and discovery. The nostalgia hits hard. A giddiness — the freedom, the low stakes, a world that's yours.

**Middle:** Investment and tension. Your crew matters. Cracks appear. Do you share a release that could get your friend in trouble? Do you confront the person whose away message has been "..." for three weeks?

**End:** Bittersweet acceptance. Not a boss fight ending — a last LAN party. People move. People get jobs. The ethernet cables get coiled up one last time. The last message goes unanswered. The best communities aren't the ones that last forever — they're the ones that mattered while they lasted.

### Story Hook

**"Your crew is falling apart, and the only thing holding it together is the next LAN party."**

### Characters (Archetypes, AI-varied each playthrough)

- **The Host (You):** The social glue. Is the thing you're building a community or a dependency?
- **The Prodigy:** Terrifyingly good at games, socially awkward. Is skill enough to belong?
- **The Scene Kid:** Deep warez connections. Cool, mysterious. What are they running from?
- **The Loudmouth:** Big opinions, picks fights for sport. Is being heard the same as being known?
- **The Ghost:** Used to be around all the time. Now always "Away." What aren't they saying?
- **The Newbie:** Just showed up. Can the community still welcome someone new?

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Adults 28-42 who grew up in the LAN party era. Played CS 1.6 in someone's garage. Used Kazaa. They will CRY at this game.

**Secondary:** 18-27 year olds nostalgic for an era they romanticize through memes and Y2K aesthetics.

**Tertiary:** Management sim enthusiasts who'll stay for the AI-driven depth.

### Comparable Games

1. **"If Papers, Please met Emily is Away"** — Interface IS gameplay, soaked in era-specific digital culture, with simulation depth and moral weight.
2. **"If The Sims met Hackers (1995)"** — AI-driven characters, warez underground setting, social stakes.
3. **"If Stardew Valley met Hypnospace Outlaw"** — Building relationships through retro digital interface with obsessive period-authenticity.
4. **"If Game Dev Tycoon met Napster"** — Building in the gaming world through grey-market channels that defined early 2000s PC culture.

### Unique Selling Proposition

**No game has ever made the 2000s desktop the GAME ITSELF — and no game has ever put AI agents behind every chat window.** Internet Cafe Sim (39% reviews) proves the market wants this but isn't getting it. LAN Party Adventures (90% positive) proves the aesthetic works. Hypnospace Outlaw proved "playable retro internet" is viable. LAN PARTY fills the gap: **authentic interface + AI replayability + management depth + emotional storytelling.**

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)** — Primary and perfect. A game about PC culture, played on a PC, through a simulated PC. The meta-layer is beautiful.

**Steam Deck** — Strong secondary. Desktop sim in handheld is weird and perfect.

**Console** — Stretch goal only. Mouse-driven sim doesn't translate easily.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **The Living Desktop** — Fully interactive 2000s OS. MSN, mIRC, browser, file manager, Winamp, WinRAR, Notepad, forum client. Each app is a game system.

2. **AI-Driven Characters** — Persistent NPCs with memory, personality, emotional states, relationships, personal goals. They initiate conversations. They post on forums. Every playthrough generates a unique cast.

3. **The LAN Party Event Loop** — Plannable, executable, emergent social events. Hardware logistics, game selection, social dynamics, real-time AI interaction.

4. **The Acquisition Underground** — Risk/reward system for obtaining games through the piracy ecosystem. Public P2P, private trackers, scene connections. Strategic depth and moral texture.

5. **Emergent Narrative Through Interfaces** — Story told through chat messages, forum posts, away messages, email, buddy list changes. No cutscenes. The medium is the message.

### Stretch Goals

1. **Dynamic Soundtrack System** — Winamp reflects game state. Characters have music preferences. Mixtape CDs as social mechanic.
2. **The Broader Internet** — Simulated browser with GeoCities pages, gaming news sites, characters' homepages.
3. **Competitive Scene Arc** — Late-game online tournaments. From basement to amateur esports.
4. **Hardware Modding System** — GPU upgrades, overclocking, custom case mods. Hardware as character expression.
5. **Multiplayer / Shared World** — Multiple players, overlapping crews. Touch ONLY when single-player is bulletproof.

### Cut List

- Voice acting (silence is a feature)
- 3D environments (the game IS the desktop)
- Real licensed games (use parodies: "CounterOps," "UnrealBattle 2003")
- Mobile port
- Historical accuracy as constraint (the year is "200X")

## Key Art / Mood Direction

**Primary image**: Dimly lit basement from above. Five CRT monitors casting blue-white light on teenager faces. Ethernet cables snaking like veins. Stack of burned CDs. Two-liter of Mountain Dew. Half-crushed Doritos bag. One monitor shows the game's desktop — MSN open, download at 73%. It's 2 AM and nobody wants to go home.

**Color palette**: CRT blue-white, LED green, amber monitor warmth, deep basement shadow. A room lit only by screens.

**Typography**: Logo looks like it was made in a free dafont.com font circa 2003. Maybe a lens flare. Maybe bevel-and-emboss. Like the title card of a CS frag movie on Google Video.

**Tone**: Cozy chaos. Not dark. Not ironic. Sincere. This game loves the era it's depicting.

## Open Questions & Next Steps

### Design [REED]
- Real-time with time controls (Rimworld) or action-triggered time (Papers, Please)?
- How deep is the game-within-a-game layer? Watch, participate, or manage?
- Session length target?
- Piracy risk balance — consequences should be SOCIAL, not mechanical?

### Narrative [NOVA]
- How to handle "end of the era" without depression? Bittersweet, not bleak.
- How much do characters reference the real world outside the screen?
- Player's online persona — built character or "themselves"?

### Marketing [HYPE]
- Announce trailer = a SCREEN RECORDING of the fake desktop. No traditional trailer. The internet will lose its mind.
- Demo = a playable desktop. Even without the LAN loop, it's a massive wishlist driver.
- This game was BUILT for Steam Next Fest.
